# sinatra-rocket

Everyone calls their repo sinatra-boilderplate. Boilerplate, but better. Here's the good stuff!

## Included 

* jQuery
* bootsrap css
* fontawesome!

Also a basic setup for tests (`ruby spec/test.rb`), layout rendering, a helpful Gemfile, and some other fun things.

Hopefully this setup rocket-boosts your sinatra apps to greatness!
